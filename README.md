# DeepCell Ecosystem Scripts

This repository contains several Python scripts that demonstrate different use cases for the DeepCell ecosystem. Each script is designed to be run independently, and may require additional setup or configuration before it can be used.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.4 or later
- DeepCell 0.8.0 or later

You can install TensorFlow and DeepCell using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install deepcell
```

## Scripts

The following scripts are included in this repository:

- `segmentation.py`: Uses DeepCell for image segmentation.
- `segmentation_train.py`: Trains a model for image segmentation using DeepCell.
- `segmentation_test.py`: Tests the `segmentation.py` script using a pre-trained model.

- `object_detection.py`: Uses DeepCell for object detection.
- `object_detection_train.py`: Trains a model for object detection using DeepCell.
- `object_detection_test.py`: Tests the `object_detection.py` script using a pre-trained model.

- `image_classification.py`: Uses DeepCell for image classification.
- `image_classification_train.py`: Trains a model for image classification using DeepCell.
- `image_classification_test.py`: Tests the `image_classification.py` script using a pre-trained model.

- `image_registration.py`: Uses DeepCell for image registration.
- `image_registration_train.py`: Trains a model for image registration using DeepCell.
- `image_registration_test.py`: Tests the `image_registration.py` script using a pre-trained model.

- `denoising.py`: Uses DeepCell for image denoising and deconvolution.
- `denoising_train.py`: Trains a model for image denoising and deconvolution using DeepCell.
- `denoising_test.py`: Tests the `denoising.py` script using a pre-trained model.

- `super_resolution.py`: Uses DeepCell for image super-resolution.
- `super_resolution_train.py`: Trains a model for image super-resolution using DeepCell.
- `super_resolution_test.py`: Tests the `super_resolution.py` script using a pre-trained model.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required software as described above.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run.
4. Run the script using the `python` command. For example:

```
python segmentation.py
```

Note that some scripts may require additional command-line arguments or configuration options. Refer to the script's documentation or comments for more information.
